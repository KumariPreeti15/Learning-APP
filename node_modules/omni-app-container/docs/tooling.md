## Pre-commit Hook

-   [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) - easily setup git hooks
-   [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) - execute scripts on staged files via git pre-commit hook

One of the most valuable processes to improve the quality of code reviews is to setup a pre-commit hook that lints and formats all code going to a PR. Linting helps catch common errors and suggests best practices. It's an automated code review. Enforcing formatting removes whole classes of nit-picky issues around layout, such as indentation variance and semi-colon usage. Our pre-commit hook can be bypassed with `git commit --no-verify`, but codebases should be kept clean of linting errors and effort should be expended to remove linting errors and warnings.

We are using [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) to easily create our git hooks. It's important to add `husky install` to your `prepare` script in `package.json` so git hooks are installed when developers run `npm install` or `npm ci`. We are using [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to run our formatter and linter as shell scripts on our staged files. These tasks run concurrently by default but can be configured to run in order, see [task concurrency](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged#task-concurrency).
